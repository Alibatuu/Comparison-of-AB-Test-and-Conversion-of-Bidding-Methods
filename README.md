# Comparison-of-AB-Test-and-Conversion-of-Bidding-Methods

## Business Problem 
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'averagebidding', as an alternative to the existing bidding type called 'maximumbidding'. One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and would like to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding. waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for Bombabomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.
